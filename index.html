        <p>I am currently a rising Sophomore at Lick-Wilmerding High School. Some of my hobbies are biking, playing baseball, and hanging out with my friends. I also enjoy building and making things like websites and lamps. A fun fact about me is that I've biked a half century and have run a half marathon. I am part of the E1T1 program because I want to gain experience and expand my knowledge with tech and code.<p>
